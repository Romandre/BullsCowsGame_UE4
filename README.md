### "Bulls and Cows" is a terminal-based word guessing game built on Unreal Engine 4.

In this game a player has to guess a hidden word while game is giving hints of how many Bulls and Cows there are foubd after each player's guess.
The Cows correspond to characters which exist in a hidden word. The Bulls correspond to characters which not only exist but also placed correctly as in a guess word.

#### The game is developed in scope of [Unreal Engine C++ Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-422-archived-course/) on Udemy.<br />

## Here is what I learned during this project development:

During this game development I’ve learned basics of navigating and operating in Unreal Engine program. Also, I’ve learned assets/objects adding and editing using available tools. As for actual development, I’ve got the general understanding of the UE C++ syntax specifics and learned about:

- actors and components;
- UE project basic structure;
- defining functions and methods with child variables;
- a variety of UE specific variable types declarations, like FString and int32;
- building and compiling the code.

<br />
Features implemented by my own outside the scope of the course:

- Revealing letters, which exist in the hidden word;
- Revealing letters, which exist and placed correctly as in hidden word;
- Overall code optimisations and syntax improvements.
