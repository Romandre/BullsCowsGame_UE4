# BullCowGame Repository

### "Bulls and Cows" is a terminal-based word guessing game built on Unreal Engine 4.

During this game development I’ve learned basics of navigating and operating in Unreal Engine program. Also, I’ve learned assets/objects adding and editing using available tools. As for actual development, I’ve got the general understanding of the UE C++ syntax specifics and learned about:

- actors and components;
- UE project basic structure;
- defining functions and methods with child variables;
- a variety of UE specific variable types declarations, like FString and int32;
- building and compiling the code.

<br />
Features implemented by my own outside the scope of the course:

- Revealing letters, which exist in the hidden word;
- Revealing letters, which exist and placed correctly as in hidden word;
- Overall code optimisations and syntax improvements.

### The game is developed in scope of Unreal Engine C++ Developer course on Udemy. <br />
